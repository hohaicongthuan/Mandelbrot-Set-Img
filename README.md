# Mandelbrot-Set-Img
> ### My attempt at writing a programme that generates an image of the Mandelbrot Set.

#### This code will generate an image (in .ppm format) of the Mandelbrot Set. The size of the image, and all other parameters can be modified directly in the source code.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?
 According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set):
> *The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_{c}(z)=z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0, i.e., for which the sequence f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value.*

## How to plot the Mandelbrot Set?
[Wiki how](https://www.wikihow.com/Plot-the-Mandelbrot-Set-By-Hand) has good examples of this.

Basically, you __take one pixel__ in the image and __convert__ the coordinate of that pixel (an image is a matrix of pixels) __into__ the __complex coordinate plane__. And then pass those complex coordinates to a function that __checks__ whether __that position__ in the complex coordinate plane __belongs to the Mandelbrot Set__. If __it does__, __return black value__ of the pixel, if __it doesn't__, __return white value__ of the pixel. And then just __repeat__ all the __above steps__ for __all the pixels__ in the image. (Hope I explained it clear enough)

About the __function__ that __checks__ whether a position in the complex plane __belongs to the Mandelbrot Set__, it just __does__ a lot of __iterations__ to __check if__ the given coordinates __satisfies__
> the function f_{c}(z)=z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0

and you are the person that specifies the number of iteration. The __more__ the number of __iteration__. the __more detail__ the Mandelbrot is and the __more time__ it'll take __to render__ the image.

Do some __researches__ yourself on how to __convert pixel coordinates to complex coordinate__.

You can search on Youtube for "Mandelbrot zoom" videos. Those are really satisfying to watch. :smile:

## What is the .PPM format?
It's the __simplest__, __lossless__ image format. Basically, it's just a file that __stores pixel__ data __using texts__ rather than binary. Therefore, the __file size__ is much __larger__, and it __doesn't provide__ any __compression__ so the bigger the image size, the greater the file size. As a result, the file will __take longer to write__ to storage device if it gets too big. However, because it's using text to encode pixel data, it's much more __readable to human__. You could just simply open a .PPM file with Notepad and modify any pixels you want. Read more about .PPM format [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm).

I chose this format because it's simple, easy to implement and I don't have to use any other librabies, which I'm not good at using.
