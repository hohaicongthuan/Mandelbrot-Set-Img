# Mandelbrot-Set-Img
> ### My attempt at writing a programme that generates an image of the Mandelbrot Set.

#### This code will generate an image (in .ppm format) of the Mandelbrot Set. The size of the image, and all other parameters can be modified directly in the source code.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?
 According to Wikipedia:
> *The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_{c}(z)=z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0, i.e., for which the sequence f_{c}(0), f_{c}(f_{c}(0)), etc., remains bounded in absolute value.*

## How to plot the Mandelbrot Set?
[Wiki how](https://www.wikihow.com/Plot-the-Mandelbrot-Set-By-Hand) has good examples of this.

## Some of the Mandelbrot Set images
**Note: The image generated by this code might not be as beautiful as in these images below... yet**

You can search on Youtube for "Mandelbrot zoom" videos. Those are really satisfying to watch. :smile:
